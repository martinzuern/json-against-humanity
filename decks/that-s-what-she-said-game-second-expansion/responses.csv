all I need is a good hoe
all pants are half off today
can I have a bite of your taco?
can I slip it in your mailbox?
can you give me a facial?
"can you keep it down, I'm working here!"
come into my rose garden
did we both finish at the same time?
did you remember to bring the wet wipes?
do you just want to do it yourself?
"don't look down, look up"
every girl oves a little rabbit
here comes the money shot
I always come the right away
I can feel a rush coming on
I can't seem to put my finger on it
"I did all the work, you clean up the mess"
I have experience on both ends
I just need a little milk for my Fruit Loops
I like to mix business with pleasure
I'd bend over backwards for you
I'd do almost anything for a hundred bucks
I'm blessed in more ways than one
I'm craving muffin tops
I'm going to go a lot deeper than you think
I'm gonna need the cash up front
I'm headed down south
I'm just yanking your chain
I'm kind of a slow learner
I'm looking for a lot of seamen
I've updated my terms and conditions
"if you swallow what's in your mouth, I'll give you more"
"if you're sitting in the first three rows, prepare to get soaked"
in the face!!!
it's a dirty job and I love to do it
it's always good to have a plan B
it's like breaking in a catcher's mitt
it's time to plug it and chug it
keep the back door shut
let me toss your salad
"let's go slow, it feels like we're gonna get caught"
let's meet at the Bush n' Tush
let's take a look under the hood
look at the size of that crack!
my mama told me not to ride with strangers
my package came today
no more coke
nobody rides for free
not a drop spilled
not everything has to be a competition
please double bag
really? you've never been inside?
"rwo in the cake, one in the pudding"
sometimes boys just have to be with other boys
"the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice"
the goal is to escape
they look like a couple of fried eggs hanging from a nail
they're starting to sag
this one's exit only
wait till you see my new toys
winter is coming
would you like a saddle or do you want to ride bareback?
you can't eat what you can't catch
you can't just wash slime away with a shower
"you need a haircut, and I'm not talking about your head"
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you'll be walking funny tomorrow
you're looking a little stiff
you're my least favorite cousin
you're quite the nutter
