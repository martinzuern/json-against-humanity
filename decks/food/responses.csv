A belly full of hard-boiled eggs.
A joyless vegan party.
A sobering quantity of chili cheese fries.
A table for one at The Cheesecake Factory.
Being emotionally and physically dominated by Gordon Ramsay.
Clamping down on a gazelle’s jugular and tasting its warm life waters.
Committing suicide at the Old Country Buffet.
Father’s forbidden chocolates.
Going vegetarian and feeling so great all the time.
Jizz Twinkies.
Kale farts.
Kevin Bacon Bits.
Licking the cake batter off of grandma’s fingers.
Not knowing what to believe anymore about butter.
Oreos for dinner.
Real cheese flavor.
Soup that’s better than pussy.
Sucking down thousands of pounds of krill every day.
Swishing the wine around and sniffing it like a big fancy man.
The Dial-A-Slice Apple Divider from Williams-Sonoma.
The Hellman’s Mayonnaise Corporation.
The hot dog I put in my vagina ten days ago.
The inaudible screams of carrots.
What to do with all of this chocolate on my penis.
