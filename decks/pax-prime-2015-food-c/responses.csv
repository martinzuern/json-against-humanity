A Mexican child trapped inside of a burrito.
Clamping down on a gazelle’s jugular and tasting its warm life waters.
Committing suicide at the Old Country Buffet.
Father’s forbidden chocolates.
Jizz Twinkies.
The Hellman’s Mayonnaise Corporation.
The hot dog I put in my vagina ten days ago.
The inaudible screams of carrots.
