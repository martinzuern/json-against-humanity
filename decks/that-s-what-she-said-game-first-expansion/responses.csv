a good pre-game stretch is a must
"blink once for yes, twice for no"
can I kiss it and make it better?
can you sign my ball?
can you swallow a sword?
getting rear-ended only hurts at high speed
here comes the climax!
I always drink the pickle juice
I could get behind that
I enjoy watching the train pull into the station
I wish my dad did this with me
I'd love a milk mustache
I'm all fingers and tongues
I'm the fun mom!
I've never gone down under
"if you clear out your junk, we can play in the back"
it didn't get hard until I went vegan
it's finger lickin' good
it's going to be nut to butt for the rest of the night
it's hump day!
it's not okay to double dip
leave the cash on the night stand
let's double the meat
looks like shag carpet is making a comeback
my honey is the best on the market
once you go black you never go back
"push it, push it real good!"
"ready or not, here I come!"
shake those pom poms!
should we invite your sister?
should we put down a tarp first?
spread your legs and put your hands on your head
that tight end is now a wide receiver
the boys are back in town
the cream rises to the top
there's a sucker born every minute
they don't pay me enough for this
this doesn't pass the sniff test
this rooster crows at the crack of dawn
"twist it, bop it, pull it"
wanna know how I got these scars?
welcome to the Forbidden Forest
you can look but don't touch
you have to try my crab dip
you must be on the naughty list
"you put your left foot in, you put your left foot out"
you'll never guess what's for dessert
you're not supposed to chew on that
your hose has a kink in it
your mother raised a beautiful succulent
